# Paint

Simple graphic editor written in Python

## Run

Install packages from requirements file:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Also you need Tkinter if you don't have it (but most probably you have it, especially on Windows), but if you don't and you're on Ubuntu-like system:

Then just run it with command:

```
python3 main.py
